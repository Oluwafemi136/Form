<h1><u><center>WHAT IS DANCING?</center></u></h1>
 <section>
<p id="What is dancing"> Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.
 Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other. Although the above broad definition covers all forms of the art, philosophers and critics throughout history have suggested different definitions of dance that have amounted to little more than descriptions of the kind of dance with which each writer was most familiar. Thus, Aristotle’s statement in the Poetics that dance is rhythmic movement whose purpose is “to represent men’s characters as well as what they do and suffer” refers to the central role that dance played in classical Greek theatre, where the chorus through its movements reenacted the themes of the drama during lyric interludes.</p></section>
<div>
<br>Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. It often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or it may interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed and performed in a theatre setting but it is not a requirement. Examples are Western ballet and modern dance, Classical Indian dance such as Bharatanatyam, and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas, such as the dragon dance. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.

<p><b><center><p style="font-size:200%">EVOLUTION OF DANCING</center></b></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p id="evolution">Evidence from multiple sources reveals a surprising link between imitation and dance. As in the classical correspondence problem central to imitation research, dance requires mapping across sensory modalities and the integration of visual and auditory inputs with motor outputs. Recent research in comparative psychology supports this association, in that entrainment to a musical beat is almost exclusively observed in animals capable of vocal or motor imitation. Dance has representational properties that rely on the dancers’ ability to imitate particular people, animals or events, as well as the audience’s ability to recognize these correspondences. Imitation also plays a central role in learning to dance and the acquisition of the long sequences of choreographed movements are dependent on social learning. These and other lines of evidence suggest that dancing may only be possible for humans because its performance exploits existing neural circuitry employed in imitation.</p>
<p><br><b>Main Text</b></p>
<p>Dance is observed in all human societies. People readily move their bodies to rhythm or music, frequently coordinating their motion with others. The apparent effortlessness and ubiquity of human dance, however, belies the complexity of the act. How is it that we are able to dance, when cats, dogs or monkeys aren’t? The scientific answer to this question reveals a surprising connection between dance and imitation.
Dancing requires the performer to match their actions to music, or to time their movements to fit the rhythm — sometimes an internal rhythm, such as the heartbeat.
This demands a correspondence between the auditory inputs that the dancer hears and the motor outputs they produce. Likewise, competent couple or group dancing requires individuals to coordinate their actions, and in the process matching, reversing or complementing each other. This too calls for a correspondence between visual inputs and motor outputs. Convergent lines of evidence suggest that people solve these challenges by harnessing the same neural architecture as deployed in imitation.</p></section>
